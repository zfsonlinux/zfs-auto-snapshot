.SH DESCRIPTION
.B zfs-auto-snapshot
automatically creates, rotates, and destroys snapshots for all your
ZFS datasets, and is compatible with both zfsonlinux and zfs-fuse.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-default\-exclude\fR
By default \fBzfs-auto-snapshot\fR will snapshot all datasets except
for those in which the user-property \fBcom.sun:auto-snapshot\fR is
set to \fBfalse\fR.  This option reverses the behavior and requires
\fBcom.sun:auto-snapshot\fR to be set to \fBtrue\fR.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
Print debugging messages.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-event\fR=\fIEVENT\fR
Set the com.sun:auto\-snapshot\-desc property to EVENT.
.TP
\fB\-\-fast\fR
Use a faster zfs list invocation.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
Print actions without actually doing anything.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-skip\-scrub\fR
Do not snapshot filesystems in scrubbing pools.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print the usage message.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-keep\fR=\fINUM\fR
Keep NUM recent snapshots and destroy older snapshots.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-label\fR=\fILAB\fR
LAB is usually 'hourly', 'daily', or 'monthly'.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-prefix\fR=\fIPRE\fR

.TP
\fB\-\-send\-incr\fR=[\fIremote host\fR]:[\fIremote pool\fR][;...]
Send zfs incremental backup to remote hostname (or IP address) and put it in remote pool.
.TP
\fB\-\-send\-fallback\fR
Allow to fallback from incremental to full snapshot replication.
.sp
This implies \fI-R\fR to \fBzfs send\fR and \fI-F\fR to \fBzfs receive\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-send\-opts\fR=\fIOPTS\fR
Option(s) passed to 'zfs send'.
.TP
\fB\-\-recv\-opts\fR=\fIOPTS\fR
Option(s) passed to 'zfs receive'.
.TP
\fB\-\-send\-ssh\-opts\fR=\fIOPTS\fR
Option(s) passed to 'ssh' in the replication command line.
.sp
See \fBssh\fR(1) for availible options.
.TP
\fB\-\-send\-mbuf\-opts\fR=\fIOPTS\fR
Use \fBmbuffer\fR (with these options) between 'zfs send' and
\'ssh <host> zfs receive <pool>'.
.sp
See \fBmbuffer\fR(1) for availible options.
.TP
\fB\-\-sep\fR=\fICHAR\fR
Use CHAR to separate date stamps in snapshot names.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-syslog\fR
Write messages into the system log.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-recursive\fR
Snapshot named filesystem and all descendants.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Print info messages.
.TP
\fB\-\-pre-snapshot\fR=\fICOMMAND\fR
Command to run before each dataset is snapshotted. 
It is passed the dataset and snapshot name. If it
returns non-zero, snapshotting this dataset is 
aborted.
.TP
\fB\-\-post-snapshot\fR=\fICOMMAND\fR
Command to run after each dataset is snapshotted. 
It is passed the dataset and snapshot name.
.TP
\fB\-\-pre-send\fR=\fICOMMAND\fR
Command to run before each snapshot is sent to
remote host. It is passed the snapshot name. If
it returns non-zero, sending this dataset is
aborted.
.TP
\fB\-\-post-send\fR=\fICOMMAND\fR
Command to run after each snapshot have been sent.
It is passed the snapshot name.
.TP
\fB\-\-destroy-only\fR
Do not create new snapshots, but do destroy older 
snapshots. Has no effect unless used with \fB\-k\fR.
.IP
A non-obvious use may be constructon of cron jobs or
scripts that run pre-snapshot command(s), then run 
zfs-auto-snapshot (without \fB\-k\fR) to quickly
snapshot all datasets, then run post-snapshot
command(s) and clean up with zfs-auto-snapshot
\fB\-\-destroy-only\fR.
.TP
name
Filesystem and volume names, or '//' for all ZFS datasets.
